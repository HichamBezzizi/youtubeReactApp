# Youtube Video Search App

![Starting screen](./src/img/ytreactapp.png)

This is a simple 1 page Youtube react app where you can search for any video and it'll display 1 main video and 4 videos which u can then click on and display it in the main video area. I plan to further build out this app slowly and see how far I can go with the Youtube API that i've been using.

[You can search for any video here!](https://youtubereactapp.netlify.com/)

## Mission

- Learn more about React.
- Learn how to use an API in React.
- Learn how to use Axios
- Learn the concept of React Hooks(useState);
- Display the data from the API in a structured way.
- Learn to work with a style Framework called Material-UI.

## How does the app work

1. Search for any video.
1. 1 video will be displayed and next to it 4 videos.
1. When you click on any of the 4 videos it will replace the one main video display.

## What did I learn from this

1. Learned how to refactor my code to use React Hooks.
1. Solidyfied my knowledge of React basics; passing data and functions as props, using reusable components and working with states.
1. Using destructuring.
1. Using Axios to fetch data from the Youtube API https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3.
1. Using Material-UI to structure my components correctly.

## What was the most challenging

Seeing how Axios worked with React and refactoring my class components into functional components when dealing with React Hooks. Also figuring out how to display 4 videos and making them clickable to then replace the main video each time a video from the videolist is clicked.
